## C. Frontend Development (Vue/Nuxt.js PWA) üöÄ

**(Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

This phase focuses on building the user-facing progressive web application using Vue.js and Nuxt.js.

### 1. Nuxt.js Project Initialization
   -   Navigate to your `frontend/` directory.
   -   Initialize a new Nuxt.js project: `npx nuxi init frontend-app` (or your preferred project name).
   -   During setup, select/ensure the following are included:
        * **Vue 3**
        * **Nuxt 3**
        * **TypeScript** (optional, but highly recommended for robustness)
        * **ESLint** (for code linting)
        * **Prettier** (for code formatting)
   -   Configure `nuxt.config.ts` for PWA features. This includes setting up the web app manifest and a basic service worker.

### 2. Core Chat UI Component üí¨
   -   Create a Vue component for the main chat interface (e.g., `ChatInterface.vue`).
   -   **Display Messages:**
        * Show messages from both the AI and the User.
        * Apply distinct styling to differentiate AI and User messages.
   -   **User Input:**
        * Include a `textarea` for users to type their messages.
        * Add a "Send" button.
   -   Implement basic API call functionality to your backend endpoint (e.g., `/api/chat`).

### 3. Sideboard UI Component üìã
   -   Create a Vue component for the Sideboard panel (e.g., `SideboardPanel.vue`).
   -   **Collapsible Functionality:**
        * Implement CSS transitions to allow the panel to slide in and out smoothly.
   -   **Active Display Area:**
        * Create a designated area within the sideboard to display dynamic content.
   -   **Sideboard History:**
        * Implement a simple list to display "Sideboard History" (this can be initially empty).

### 4. Contextual Input Module Component üìù
   -   Create a generic and reusable Vue component (e.g., `ContextualInputModule.vue`).
   -   This component should be capable of rendering different input types based on props or data passed to it.
   -   **"Solemn Process" Behavior:**
        * When active, this module should overlay the main chat input.
        * Disable interactions with the main chat interface.
        * Require explicit user action via "Save" or "Cancel" buttons to proceed.
   -   **Initial Configuration:**
        * Set it up to render a single text input field for capturing the user's name.
   -   Implement an API call to `/api/submit-name` when the "Save" button is clicked.

### 5. Dynamic UI Rendering Logic ‚ú®
   -   In your main chat component, add logic to interpret incoming API responses from your FastAPI backend.
   -   **Conditional Rendering:**
        * If the API response includes a `component_id` (e.g., `name_input`), render the `ContextualInputModuleComponent` with the provided data.
        * If the API response includes a `sideboard_display_id`, update the content of the `SideboardUIComponent`'s active-display-area.

### 6. Collapsible Exchange Unit (Basic) üîÑ
   -   Implement the visual structure for a single collapsible unit representing an exchange in the chat history.
   -   For demonstration purposes, manually hardcode an initial AI greeting and subsequent user/AI messages into a single exchange.
   -   Include a miniature view or summary of the Sideboard content relevant to this exchange within the unit.

## D. Integration & "Hello World" Flow Execution üåê

**(Estimated Time: 1 Day)**

This phase involves connecting the frontend and backend to achieve a basic end-to-end "Hello World" interaction.

### 1. Orchestrate Initial Flow
   1.  **PWA Load:** When the Progressive Web App loads, the frontend can either send an initial "start chat" signal, or the backend can proactively send the first AI message.
   2.  **User "Hello":** User types "Hello" into the chat input. This message is sent to the FastAPI backend, which then routes it to the CrewAI `GreetingAgent`.
   3.  **Name Input Trigger:** The `GreetingAgent` processes the "Hello" and triggers the `ContextualInputModuleTool`, configured for name input. The backend signals the frontend to display this module.
   4.  **User Enters Name:** The user enters their name via the `ContextualInputModule` on the frontend. This name is sent via an API call (e.g., `/api/submit-name`) to FastAPI, which passes it to the `GreetingAgent`.
   5.  **Sideboard Update Trigger:** The `GreetingAgent` processes the name and triggers the `SideboardDisplayTool` to show a welcome message in the Sideboard. The backend signals the frontend to update the Sideboard.
   6.  **Chat History Update:** The `ConversationManagerAgent` (or the `GreetingAgent` in this minimal setup) updates its internal state to create and store the single `Collapsible Exchange Unit` representing this initial interaction in the chat history. The frontend reflects this update.

### 2. Manual Testing ‚úÖ
   -   Verify the PWA loads correctly in a mobile browser.
   -   Confirm that chat messages (user to AI, AI to user) are exchanged successfully.
   -   Ensure the `ContextualInputModule` appears for name input, allows text entry, and disappears after submission or cancellation.
   -   Check that the Sideboard displays the dynamically updated content (e.g., the welcome message).
   -   Verify that the single `Collapsible Exchange Unit` is correctly rendered in the chat history.

## E. CI/CD Pipeline (Basic Implementation) ‚öôÔ∏è

**(Estimated Time: 1 Day)**

Set up a basic Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline to automate testing and deployment.

### 1. Configure GitHub Actions (or your chosen CI/CD tool)

   **a. Backend Workflow (`backend/`)**
      -   Create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`).
      -   Define jobs for:
          * **Python Dependency Installation:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or similar).
          * **Linting:** Run tools like `flake8` and `black --check`.
          * **Testing:** Execute basic tests using `pytest`.
      -   **Docker Build & Push:** On a successful Pull Request merge to the `main` branch:
          * Build a Docker image for the backend.
          * Push the image to your DigitalOcean Container Registry.

   **b. Frontend Workflow (`frontend/`)**
      -   Create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml`).
      -   Define jobs for:
          * **Node.js Dependency Installation:** `npm install` or `yarn install`.
          * **Linting:** Run tools like `eslint . --ext .vue,.js,.jsx,.cjs,.mjs,.ts,.tsx,.cts,.mts --fix` and `prettier --check .`.
          * **Testing:** Execute basic frontend tests using `vitest` or `jest`.
      -   **Build & Deploy PWA:**
          * Build the Nuxt.js PWA: `npm run build`.
          * Deploy the static assets (from the `.output/public` directory for Nuxt 3) to an Nginx-served directory on your Droplet (e.g., using `rsync` over SSH).
