Comprehensive Deployment Fix Report (Revised)

1. Current Issues Identified
* 1.1 Nginx Configuration Issues
* Error: unknown directive in /etc/nginx/conf.d/fastapi.conf:1
* Root Cause Diagnosis: Nginx is loading configurations from /etc/nginx/conf.d/ (where a potentially problematic fastapi.conf exists) in addition to sites-enabled/. Your deployment script previously focused on /etc/nginx/sites-available/. This leftover or conflicting fastapi.conf is likely the source of Nginx errors.
* 1.2 Frontend Build Warnings
* Warning: [@nuxt/content] No content configuration found
* Impact: Non-critical for immediate functionality but should ideally be addressed for a clean build process (e.g., by adding a basic content config to nuxt.config.ts if the module is used, or removing/disabling the module if not).

2. Proposed Solution
* 2.1 Nginx Configuration Fix (Revised Strategy)
* Thorough Cleanup of Existing Configs:
* Ensure removal of any potentially conflicting Nginx configurations for this site from all standard include paths before deploying the new configuration. This specifically includes:
* Files within /etc/nginx/conf.d/ (such as the problematic fastapi.conf or any old versions of mindbridge.conf).
* Any existing mindbridge file in /etc/nginx/sites-available/.
* Any existing mindbridge symlink in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/.
* Standardized Configuration Deployment:
* Deploy your new mindbridge.conf (from your repository, which will be rsynced to a location like /opt/mb-final/nginx/mindbridge.conf on the server) exclusively to /etc/nginx/sites-available/mindbridge.
* Then, ensure the symbolic link is correctly created/updated from /etc/nginx/sites-available/mindbridge to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/mindbridge.
* This approach ensures a single, clear source for your site's server block configuration and avoids conflicts with files in /etc/nginx/conf.d/.
* Enhanced Error Reporting in Deployment Script:
* Add detailed logging within deploy.sh if Nginx configuration tests (nginx -t) fail.
* Upon failure, the script should attempt to log relevant information such as ls -l /etc/nginx/conf.d/ /etc/nginx/sites-available/ /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ and cat /etc/nginx/sites-available/mindbridge to help diagnose issues.
* 2.2 Deployment Script (deploy.sh) Updates
* Changes Made/To Be Ensured: The deploy.sh script will handle the Nginx cleanup and standardized configuration deployment as described in section 2.1. It will also manage directory creation for frontend assets, backend service restarts, and incorporate improved error handling, logging, and verification steps.

3. Implementation Plan
* 3.1 Files to Be Modified/Created
* nginx/mindbridge.conf (in repository): This file will contain your correct Nginx configuration.
* deploy.sh (in repository): This script will be updated/confirmed to implement the revised Nginx handling (cleanup, copy to sites-available, symlink to sites-enabled, test, reload) and other deployment tasks.
* .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml: Ensure the deploy job correctly rsyncs nginx/mindbridge.conf and deploy.sh to the server (e.g., to /opt/mb-final/nginx/mindbridge.conf and /opt/mb-final/deploy.sh respectively) and then executes deploy.sh.
* 3.2 Steps to Implement
1.  Local Testing: Test the updated deploy.sh logic in a local Docker environment or a non-critical development server if possible. Verify Nginx configuration is correctly applied and services work.
2.  Staging Deployment: Deploy the changes to a dedicated staging environment that mirrors production as closely as possible. Verify all services start correctly and test API and frontend access thoroughly.
3.  Production Deployment:
* Schedule a maintenance window or deploy during low-traffic hours.
* Ensure you have a backup of the current working Nginx configuration on the server.
* Run the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the changes.
* Verify functionality as per section 5.

4. Risk Assessment
* 4.1 Potential Risks
* Downtime Risk: Possible if Nginx fails to reload or services don't start correctly.
* Mitigation: Deploy during low-traffic hours. Have a tested rollback plan.
* Configuration Conflicts (despite cleanup): An unexpected Nginx configuration elsewhere on the system could still interfere.
* Mitigation: The thorough cleanup in deploy.sh should minimize this. Detailed error reporting in deploy.sh will help identify issues if nginx -t fails.
* 4.2 Rollback Plan
1.  Revert the codebase to the previous working commit in Git.
2.  Manually restore the backed-up Nginx configuration on the server if needed.
3.  Restart/reload the Nginx service.
4.  Rerun the (old) deployment pipeline or manually redeploy the previous version of services.

5. Verification Steps
* Nginx:
* The nginx -t command (run by deploy.sh) must pass.
* systemctl status nginx on the server should show active (running).
* Check Nginx error logs (/var/log/nginx/error.log) for any new issues.
* Application:
* The frontend website should be accessible via its domain/IP.
* Key API endpoints should respond correctly (e.g., the /api/health check).
* Static files (CSS, JS, images) for the frontend should be served properly.
